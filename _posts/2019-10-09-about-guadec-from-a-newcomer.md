This year I attended to GUADEC for the first time. It was also my first conference ever, Iâ€™ve never been to a FOSS conference or any other kind of conference. Maybe what I have to share about the whole experience is not something new to anyone who attends to conference with some frequency, or maybe it is something they donâ€™t really even notice since they are already used to the whole environment ðŸ˜› Anyway, I am hoping my report encourages folks who have never been to GUADEC or other FOSS conferences.

# Talks
## 1st day

I sadly missed the Opening because the app showing the way to the venue was wrong ): I was lost for about 40 minutes without being able to find anyone who knew how to get to the University. It was tough, but I bravely took a cab that made me realize I was actually very close. And happily, I was there on time to watch Britt Yazelâ€™s talk about [Setting a Positive Voice for GNOME](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/setting-a-positive-voice-for-gnome/), and, after that, I watched Sriram Ramkrishnaâ€™s talk [Gitlab â€“ A Year in Review and What Should Come Next](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/gitlab-a-year-in-review-and-what-should-come-next/).

After a very good coffee break where Georges Stavracas introduced me some folks, I watched Nathan Willisâ€™ talk about home automation ([GNHOME AUTTOMQATION](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/gnhome-auttomqation/)), which, to be honest, I didnâ€™t understand very well at some points, but as someone who is interested in Home Automation stuff. I was very curious to search more about it later, it never came to my mind I could have an option to use free software to do this â€“ and actually, one of the reasons I never started automating my house is that I donâ€™t want anybody spying my house heh

After their talks, I found out I couldnâ€™t buy the mealâ€™s plan anymore xD So I went to a group of people to ask if they were having lunch and they were actually organizing to go to the **newcomers lunch**. We had a good time together and we ate a really good Greek meal.

Back to the venue, it was time for the intern **lightning talks**, where GSoC students and Outreachy interns (a.k.a. me) gave a talk about their projects. I was terribly nervous and so in shock that I canâ€™t even recall now about what I said â€“ and I didnâ€™t want to watch it after it was available online heh It was my first talk in English, and even though I really knew what I had to say and it was only for 5 minutes, I was really scared. That moment was exactly when I realized everyone was interested in what I had to say, they were paying attention even when I had to stop and think about what I was going to say. And after my lightning talk, some people even stopped me to say they enjoyed it. I was really worried that maybe it didnâ€™t go well, but everyone was so nice to me that I felt it was fine whether I was nervous or not, people got my message.

## 2nd day
I watched Philip Withnallâ€™s talk about [Environmentally Friendly GNOME](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/environmentally-friendly-gnome-part-1/), StellaMaris Njageâ€™s and Sigu Migwaâ€™s talk about [Building the GNOME Community in Africa](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/building-the-gnome-community-in-africa/), Jakub Steinerâ€™s talk about App Icons ([Simple is Hard â€“ Creating Beautiful App Icons](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/simple-is-hard-creating-beautiful-app-icons/)) and Allan Dayâ€™s talk about [GNOME UX: Strategies & Tactics](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/gnome-ux-strategies-tactics/).

Georges Stavracasâ€™ talk about [Mainteners and Contributors](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/about-maintainers-and-contributors/) was specially very interesting to me â€“ as I am new to contributing there are lots of things I still didnâ€™t experience, and I even though I already knew him before the conference, I still didnâ€™t know how he started to contribute and what was his experience.

## 3rd day â€“ giving a talk to famous people
It was finally the day of my talk about [Usability Testing](https://guadec.ubicast.tv/videos/usability-testing/). My talk was so important! I had stars like Allan Day, Federico Quintero, Deb Nicholson, Renata Gegaj, my GSoC friends and other GNOME friends watching me. I talked about why usability is important, how to do usability tests, showing how I did mine during my internship. I told everyone too about how was it to work with GNOME, how it did feel like and I told them how nervous I was every time I had to talk to Allan or Jim Hall, my mentor, and that I thought when I arrived that everyone was going to be very serious there, but the opposite happened and I felt very well between the community. After I finished my presentation, many people had questions and I felt people were really interested in what I presented, I was very happy about that.

## SpinachCon BoF
In this BoF, which was organized by Deb Nicholson and Sriram Ramkrishna, I got the chance of knowing a different way of running usability tests: SpinachCon is a conference where developers can bring their designs, volunteers run some tasks and tell them where the usability is not good. We ran tests on some GNOME programs and I had fun sharing what I know about usability tests with everyone there. I definitely want to run SpinachCons to test some projects here!

## Epanomi Beach
We had this whole day to go to the beach, relax and have fun together. I loved spending more time with the friends I made during the event!

Iâ€™d like to thank everyone who made this possible â€“ organizers, the travel committee, contributors, speakers, friends and GNOME Foundation for sponsoring me â€“ it was better than I could ever imagine. Everyone was very nice, I learned a lot and I really felt the sense of community between everyone and I want to continue being part of this.
